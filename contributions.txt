Sandesh:
1. Create a grid of arbitrary dimensions and appropirately fill it with traffic map elements
2. Initialize the grid with a uniform distribution of cars.
3. Create traffic light stuctures and develop traffic light cycle. Create function to update traffic lights.
4. car velocity maps: Record and save velocities of cars at every timestep, and save the flow of traffic along a direction to file. Create visualizations. 
5. Print functions to save snapshots of the grid at various time steps.
7. Functions to record average wait time for cars on the grid. Worked with Scott to further refine and code these metrics.
8. Analysis: Create and analyze velocity maps for various regmines (with and without randomization, with and without traffic lights, etc.)]
9. Analysis: Stop Time ratio analyses.


Scott:
1. Created traffic.h file
2. Wrote code for simulation loop and car spawner functions.
3. Other miscellaneous changes to environment map code
4. Analysis: number of cars vs time and number of cars vs. avg spawn rate. 



Felice:
1. Was responsible for writing functions that govern the movement of vehicles on the map 
(calculates new velocity, position, acceleration and deceleration, and stopping at red lights). 
2. Wrote ghost car function to generate ghost cars at lights. 
3. Functions are saved in the car kinematics file.
4. Analysis: Verification of car movements analysis and diagrams
5. Analysis: Fundamental traffic flow diagram analysis - flow vs density

While the above listed work is what each person was responsible for, we also spent a significant amount of time working with each other to debug and improve each other's codes.
