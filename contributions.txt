Sandesh (mainly env_map):
1. Create a grid of arbitrary dimensions and appropirately fill it with traffic map elements
2. Initialize the grid with a uniform distribution of cars.
3. Create traffic light stuctures and develop traffic light cycle. Create function to update traffic lights.
4. car velocity maps: Record and save velocities of cars at every timestep, and save the flow of traffic along a direction to file. Create visualizations. 
5. Print functions to save snapshots of the grid at various time steps.
6. Analysis: Create and analyze velocity maps for various regmines (with and without randomization, with and without traffic lights, etc.)
