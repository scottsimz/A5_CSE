1. waitList.c : Sample code that can be used to implement lists in our simulation. I adapted this using Karl's code. Functionality includes: creating a new list with MAX_SIZE, adding elements to the end of the list (and reallocing the size if max_size is crossed), removing elements, freeing memory for list.
